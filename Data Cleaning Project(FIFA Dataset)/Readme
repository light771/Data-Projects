Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook
Steps Involved

1. Loading Data:

2. Imported the dataset using Pandas.

3. Handling Missing Values:
Identified and handled missing values in the dataset.

4. Data Transformation:
Converted data types to appropriate formats.
Parsed and formatted specific columns for consistency (e.g., player names, ratings).

5. Feature Engineering:
Created new features for better analysis.
Extracted relevant information from complex columns.

6. Data Cleaning:
Removed duplicates.
Handled outliers and inconsistencies.

Key Code Snippets
Loading Data:

python

Copy code
import pandas as pd
fifa = pd.read_csv('FIFA_data.csv')

Handling Missing Values:

fifa.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)
Data Transformation:

fifa['W/F'] = fifa['W/F'].str.replace('â˜…', '').astype(int)

Data Cleaning:

fifa.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

Conclusion
The cleaned dataset is now ready for detailed analysis and visualization, providing insights into player statistics and trends.
